# PennyLane Support

PennyLane, as a leading quantum machine learning framework, has a growing community of learners working through coding challenges ranging from basic quantum circuits to advanced algorithms.

Challenge for you is to build a community-driven support conversations platform for PennyLane quantum computing challenges that enables learners to seek help, share knowledge, and collaborate on coding challenges through a structured conversation system.

Included within this task are two data files to get you started:

1. `pennylane_coding_challenges.json` - which contains data about coding challenges that users are interacting with and trying to solve.
2. `pennylane_support_conversations.json` - Which contains support conversation data relating to the coding challenges
3. (Here’s the link to the data files)[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13EnjK_AETqIvTjor4zoJrz4Kjdaroter] that you can work with for this assignment. Feel free to
add or update fields as you see fit.

### Requirements

* Create a normalized, scalable database to store & manage coding challenges and related support conversations.
* Provide comprehensive APIs to view coding challenges and manage support conversation data.
    * A user can browse coding challenges and create support conversations.
    * PennyLane support team can view, assign, reply to and manage all support conversations.
* Create an intuitive web interface for browsing challenges and creating support conversations as a user, with the support system being the main focus of this assignment.
* Send us a link to the project's GitHub repository and Include instructions to setup and run your application.

### Some guidelines:
* We are not testing your visual design skills, but the UI/UX should be clean and efficient and enable users to browse in a meaningful way.
* We don’t expect you to spend more than a few hours on this.
